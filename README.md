# 🧠 Bird Migration Analysis – SQL + Pandas/seaborn for visuaisation 

This project is designed to demonstrate my practical skills in SQL and Visualization using Python. The dataset was downoladed from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/bird-migration-dataset-data-visualization-eda
> 🎯 This project combines knowledge gained from university coursework with self-directed learning.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Bird_MigrationsSQL_PD.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all code and visualizations
-  `README.md` – Project summary and explanation (this file
- `bird_migration_data.xls` – Dataset from kaggle

📌 Objectives
The primary goal of this case study was to demonstrate practical skills in working with structured data using SQL queries within Python, followed by insightful visualizations built using Pandas and Seaborn.

This project involved:

Loading and cleaning data from an Excel file

Writing custom SQL queries using sqlite3/pandasql to extract meaningful patterns and groupings

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) directly from SQL results

Creating visualizations in Pandas and Seaborn based on SQL-derived data

Extracting insights and translating them into clear narratives

🤝 While the core work was my own, I leveraged Stack Overflow and AI-based tools (e.g., ChatGPT) as learning aids during the project — reflecting how modern analysts problem-solve collaboratively and iteratively.
